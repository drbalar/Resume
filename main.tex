  % IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
  %
  % This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
  % default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
  % on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
  % operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

  % TODO:
  % 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
  % 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
  % 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
  % 4. Add location/address information
  % 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
  % 
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  %
  % CHANGELOG:
  % v1.1:
  % 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
  % 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
  % 3. Added Last Updated
  % 4. Move Title styling into .sty
  % 5. Commented .sty file.
